Congressmen: Crooks or Honest Investors 

 Historically congressmen have been elected to represent there districts in good faith efforts to do the right thing for thier constitutents. However, recently there has been questions around if these elected officials are using there positions to take advantage of trading markets. 
 
 Most active traders in Democratic party?
From the Democratic party Josh Gottheimer and Susie Lee are the two most active traders.Their top 5 transactions were not from the same companies. 

 Most active trader in Republican party?
In the republican party Virginia Fox and Kevin Hern were the two most active. Their top 5 transactions were not from the same companies either. 

 Using all the data that was collected it seems that the congressmen we looked into are honest investors. That's only from what we can see from their trading portfolios. They make it seem as if we have full transparency but, there are things we can't see.
