## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Historically congressmen have been elected to represent their districts in good faith efforts to do the right thing for their constituents.  However, recently, there have been questions about whether these elected officials are using their positions to take advantage of trading markets.  This heightened scrutiny around trading habits has led to some laws, such as the STOCK Act and other proposals to regulate those taking advantage of the system.  However, even with the current laws, it is still difficult to prove that any wrongdoing (i.e., insider trading, disaster profiteering, or biased lawmaking) has occurred because the congressmen self-report their trades. And the violation for not reporting is $200. To unveil some of these questionable practices, our project will focus on four members of the House of Representatives and seek to determine if there were any improprieties.
